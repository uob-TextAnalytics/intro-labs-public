    "Read the text and the code then look for 'TODOs' that instruct you to complete some missing code. Look out for 'QUESTIONS' which you should try to answer before moving on to the next cell. Aim to work through the lab during the scheduled lab hours. To get help, you can talk to TAs or the lecturer during the labs, post questions to Blackboard (anonymously) or on Teams in the QA channel (with your name), or ask a question in the Wednesday live sessions. \n",
